div is a block element
span is an inline element.

This means that to use them semantically, divs should be used to wrap sections of a document, while spans should be used to wrap small portions of text, images, etc.

If you wanted to do something with some inline text, <span> is the way to go since it will not introduce line breaks that a <div> would.

As noted by others, there are some semantics implied with each of these, most significantly the fact that a <div> implies a logical division in the document, akin to maybe a section of a document (this is very important in my opinion).
